Frequency distributions of the variables and also consider the differences between the sexes and regions.
Are the values of the individual variables comparatively homogeneous within the
individual subregions and heterogeneous between different subregions?
Are there bivariate correlations between the variables?
How have the values of the variables changed over the last 20 years, i.e. comparing
2002 with 2022?
